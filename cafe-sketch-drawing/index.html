<p>R/drawing this is a subreddit for artists who particularly enjoy drawing and/or are interested in sharing their techniques. Sketchbook cafe tuesday, august 12, 2014. This week for class i decided to give myself a time limit of 30 seconds to 1 minute to draw each of my sketches. We gather every friday in various relaxed eateries and coffee shops, from the west end to richmond, to draw our surroundings and chat through the afternoon. I really wanted to capture interaction between parent and child during the whole santa event the most and to keep my drawings kind of children�s book style simplicity to reflect that look. For the last sketch of my ‘drawing people at work’ series*, i wanted to capture the atmosphere of a place and show what it might feel like to work there.</p>
