Drag up or down over the size control to set the brush tip size, and then do the same for flow to control the amount applied with each stroke. Symmetry tools are a necessity for digital artists and designers and the fact that photoshop, sketch and draw don�t have this included is very frustrating and impedes workflow. Draw with pencils, pens, markers, erasers, thick acrylic, ink brush, soft pastel and watercolor paint brushes to create artwork that can be sent as layered files to adobe photoshop or adobe illustrator.</p>
