<p>Try to sketch the archetypes of the properties of the concepts or associations of words. To keep proportions more in control a system called crating can be used this is particularly valuable when drawing in isometric (3d). We’ll begin by starting a sketch on the front plane and inserting an image. However, for conventional engineering drawing, drawing in perspective is an unnecessary complication and is usually ignored.</p>
