<p>Physics 12 Field and Force, Draw arrows on the compasses to show which way they’d be pointing. Magnetic fields can be mapped out using small plotting compasses: Draw the magnetic field lines for the bar magnet shown in the diagram below. Inside the magnet the magnetic lines move from the south to the north pole. Repeat the process until you have drawn as many lines.</p>
