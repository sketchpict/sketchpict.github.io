<p>The readme project → events → community forum → github education → github stars program → In our recent paper, “a neural representation of sketch drawings”, we present a generative recurrent neural network capable of producing sketches of common objects, with the goal of training a machine to draw and generalize abstract concepts in a manner similar to humans. A neural representation of sketch drawings. The data representation is similar to the slightly more elaborate data representation later used in google’s “quic, draw!” dataset and the subsequent paper “a neural representation of sketch drawings” by ha and eck. We outline a framework for conditional and unconditional sketch generation, and describe. Drawing is a universal communication method that transcends barriers to link human societies.</p>
