<p>Create an isometric and oblique sketches from an actual object. Use of freehand sketching freehand sketching benefits the entire process in engineering communication: The freehand sketching techniques described in this lesson apply to all engineering disciplines. This video introduces how you can learn how to freehand sketch objects with only a pencil and blank paper. By drawing vertical or horizontal lines and rotating the paper at 90 degrees angle is the easiest way to draw a rectangle and may be drawn in many other ways.
