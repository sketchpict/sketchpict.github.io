<p>Unit 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 Engineering, In the comparison drawing, the differences are highlighted as change sets, using revision clouds. In design and technical drawing in industrial design, a piece is represented from different points of view, perpendicular to the natural coordinate axes. Architectural drawing, building, floor plans, installers, m&amp;e drawing are included in construction drawing. The result displays in a new drawing called the comparison.</p>
