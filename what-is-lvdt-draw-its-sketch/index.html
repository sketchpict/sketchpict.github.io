<p>LVDT Displacement Transducer LVDT Position Sensor AML, It is the most widely used inductive transducer that converts the linear motion into the electrical signal. The linear variable differential transformer (lvdt) (also called linear variable displacement transformer, linear variable displacement transducer, or simply differential transformer) is a type of electrical transformer used for measuring linear displacement (position). It works on the principle of mutual inductance, that generates an.</p>
