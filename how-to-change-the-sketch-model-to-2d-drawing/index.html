<p><strong>How To Change The Sketch Model To 2D Drawing</strong>, You can insert details in drawing views and drawings in any model. All z coordinate information is removed in the new drawing. Using tools, such as the scale tool, that modify geometry based on the drawing axes:</p>

<p>The more views your drawing has, the more detailed and accurate we can make your 3d model. A 2d drawing view allows you to quickly create or modify a drawing view without making changes to a part or assembly document. Inventor drawings can display 2d and 3d geometry but sometimes it requires some additional clicks to show the 2d content in the drawing. For 2d files, export multiple cad files limiting layers as appropriate in each to manage clutter when in sketchup.</p>

<p>Viewbase almost worked, but all of the parts show up in every copy, unless someone knows how to turn of the layers for each individual copy. When you align the edges that you want to modify with the axes, you can modify your geometry a little more easily. When your model cannot be printed or milled directly by a machine, for example it is too big (a building) or it requires manual assembly after the pieces are ready, you will usually need to explain to another person how things fit together. 2d sketches will be used to create 3d features. You should now have a 3d model of your drawing. Using sketch mode, along with constraints and dimensions, you can draw plane geometry and define relations between the geometric entities that you draw.</p>
