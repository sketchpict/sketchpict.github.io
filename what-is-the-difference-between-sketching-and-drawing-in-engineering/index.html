<p>Drawing can simply be defined as making marks on a surface. Sketches lack detail and have many lines that are part of the visual image. The following points must be kept in mind while drawing an oblique sketch: They give the artist the opportunity to experiment with perspective and proportion. “an oblique sketch puts more focus on the face or front of an object while an isometric sketch puts more focus on the edge of an object. Sketchup and blender are entirely different.</p>
