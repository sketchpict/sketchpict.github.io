<p><strong>I Love Sketches More Then Final Drawings</strong>, My two more recent ones are less vivid, maybe because i don�t have as many feelings as i did when i was 17 or 20, or maybe because almost all of the drawings were done while giggling with chelsey in jordin�s class. As ive only just begun sketching dsos, it would be nice to have some replies to add to this for those of you that have been doing it for some time. Draw your vision loosely and in black and white before refining your sketches.</p>
