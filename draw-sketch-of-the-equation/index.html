<p><strong>Draw Sketch Of The Equation</strong>, A common technique for obtaining a sketch of the graph of an equation in two vari ables is to first plot several points that lie on the graph and then connect the points with a smooth curve. The image below shows a sine wave equation. Watch the tutorial, below, in which we see how this method works.</p>

<p>Let me escape the type off polar equation. Draw a sketch for the linear equation y = 2x + 4. This is just one specific example, but this will be applicable in all cases, we just type it in. The sign of a a determines whether the parabola opens upward ( a &gt; 0 a &gt; 0) or opens downward ( a &lt;0 a &lt; 0 ).</p>
