<p>A tentative draft (as for a literary work) 2 : So, just why do we care about direction fields? Field sketches are roughly drawn sketches of what you observe. Drawing instruments include graphite pencils, pen and ink, various kinds of paints, inked brushes, colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, erasers, markers, styluses, and metals (such as silverpoint).digital drawing is the act of drawing on graphics.</p>
