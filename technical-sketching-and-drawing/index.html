<center>Examples of Technical Drawings Everitt and Jones From everittandjones.co.uk</center>
<p>Technical drawing, drafting or drawing, is the act and discipline of composing drawings that visually communicate how something functions or is constructed. Technical sketches are made with a pencil, paper, and an idea, while technical drawing advances a sketch to follow specific technical drawing guidelines that employ the use of tools, such as isometric graph paper and the aid of a computer. We will treat sketching and drawing as one. One of the reasons people are put off drawing up plans is that technical drawings / orthographic projections / engineering drawings can appear very very complicated.</p>
