Many customers when they first start with solidworks have a design office drawing standard that states that specific items must appear in specific colours and so their solidworks template needs to be customised to use coloured layers. I’ve manually selected and changed the line color but it won’t change. Is it possible to show a sketch in my drawing that was created in my model? The only way i can get these to show up in the drawing is by adding a crop view. Here are a few hidden items along with overriding colours in layers and line.</p>
