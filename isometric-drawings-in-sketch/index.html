<p>In this case, all the lines parallel to its major axes are measurable. An isometric drawing is a 3d representation of an object such as building, room or design that often used by artists and designers to represent 3d forms on a 2d picture plane. An image in an isometric sketch is drawn in such a way that the measurement of an original image remains the same regardless of its position. How does isometric sketch create representation? Use isometric grid paper (30, 90, 150 lines) or underlay paper to provide the axes and sketch the object. To achieve this, oblique sketches are usually drawn using a 45 degree angle to render the 3rd dimension while isometric sketches are drawn using a 30 degree angle.</p>
