<p><strong>Field Drawing Line Fields Sketching</strong>, In making your drawings, i want you to draw lines of force. A direction field (or slope field / vector field) is a picture of the general solution to a first order differential equation with the form. Therefore by drawing a curve through consecutive slope lines, you can find a solution to the differential equation.</p>

<p>Make sure you are sketching continuous field lines. You will now have an accurate representation of magnetic ﬁ eld lines. The slope field is a cartesian grid where you draw lines in various directions to represent the slopes of the tangents to the solution. Depict all your playground layout ideas easily.</p>
