<p>The true intent of sketching is to work out ideas while generating and communicating a design intent. Simple sketches may include using simple lines, shapes and scribbles to represent copy and images. So i felt like my last video left some questions unanswered, so i decided in this video to do my best to answer most of them.final image: Hey everyone, this is a video about a method to drawing i�ve termed iterative drawing because it requires you to improve through many iterations of a drawi.</p>

<p>Taking color and value notes, and texture swatches, recording data for painting from memory assisted by notes in the immediate aftermath of sketching. It’s not simply the act of thinking of something and drawing it. Character sketching is often an iterative process. You can draw buttons, create tags, and plot multiple screens or ideas using the wireframe library. The artist begins with a rough geometric massing (leftmost image), which helps ensure correct proportions and perspective. Sketching in the broad sense, as an activity, is not just a byproduct of design.</p>
