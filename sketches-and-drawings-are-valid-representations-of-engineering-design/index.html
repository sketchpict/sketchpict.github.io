<p>Over this time an intuitive engineering drawing checklist has been formulated to capture all the typical errors seen over the years. Thus designers do not have a clear idea about how design representations are perceived by their audience. The graphics of engineering design and construction may very well be the most important course of all studies for an engineering or technical career. They carry a design from conception to construction. They are introduced to standard paper sizes and drawing view. The indisputable reason why graphics or drawing is so extremely important is that it is the language of the designer, technician, sanitarian, and engineer, used to communicate designs and construction</p>
