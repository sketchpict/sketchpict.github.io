<p>Conventional methods for this task often rely on the availability of the temporal order of sketch strokes, additional cues acquired from different modalities and supervised augmentation of sketch datasets with real images, which also limit the applicability and feasibility of these methods in real scenarios. Quickdraw, a dataset of vector drawings obtained by the quick, draw! The quickdraw dataset is curated from the millions of drawings contributed by over 15 million people around the world who participated in the quick, draw! a.i. Each drawing comes with specific variables: You can learn more about the model by reading this blog post or the paper. “word” — the class label of that drawing “country code” — country of origin of the drawer “timestamp” — timestamp of the drawing “recognized” — indication of the app’s successful prediction</p>
