<p><strong>Sketch Vs Drawing Vs Schematic</strong>, As nouns the difference between schematic and diagram is that schematic is a drawing or sketch showing how a system works at an abstract level while diagram is a plan, drawing, sketch or outline to show how something works, or show the relationships between the parts of a whole. Schematic diagrams only depict the significant components of a system, though some details in the diagram may also.
