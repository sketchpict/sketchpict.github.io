<p>The 2d sketch in red is a projection of the 3d sketch. In the 2d sketch, you can sketch a line that is parallel to other lines and add end points that are coincident. When you draw you create apicture of something without proportioning it and you usually colorit. The man in the street will see these two words and concepts as very similar.</p>

<p>To establish the actual difference between drawing and sketching, we first have to define the two terms in detail. Construction geometry is visible only while you are working on a sketch; It is important to know the difference between sketch a graph &amp; draw a graph. The 2d sketch in red is a projection of the 3d sketch. What is the difference between sketch geometry and construction geometry?
