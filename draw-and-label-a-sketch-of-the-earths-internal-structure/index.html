<p><strong>Draw And Label A Sketch Of The Earths Internal Structure</strong>, When introducing the structure of the earth, a diagram is essential to helping students visually understand each part. Make sure you keep the labels aligned and slightly away from the drawing to keep things clear. Each structural feature is reduced in size 10 times from one drawing to the next and compared with a new fea­ ture :</p>
